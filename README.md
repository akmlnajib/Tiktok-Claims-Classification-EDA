# TikTok Claims Classification - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Project Overview
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for a machine learning model that classifies claims made in videos submitted to TikTok. As part of the TikTok data team, the objective is to analyze, clean, and visualize data to gain insights and prepare it for further modeling and decision-making.

## Project Goal
- Import relevant packages and TikTok data into Python.
- Perform EDA and data cleaning.
- Assess Tableau measures and dimensions.
- Select and build appropriate visualizations.
- Create plots to visualize variables and relationships.
- Share insights with stakeholders through an executive summary.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains various attributes related to video submissions on TikTok, including:
- Video metadata
- Claims made in videos
- User interactions and engagement metrics

Note: Due to confidentiality, the dataset is not included in this repository.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tiktok-claims-classification-eda.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd tiktok-claims-classification-eda
   ```
3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Open `eda_tiktok_claims.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run the notebook cells to load data, perform cleaning, and visualize key insights.
3. Use Tableau to create additional interactive visualizations for presentations.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Exploratory analysis with descriptive statistics.
- Correlation analysis and visualization of variable relationships.
- Summary insights for non-technical stakeholders.

## Results and Visualizations
Key findings and visualizations will be detailed here after the completion of the EDA process.
